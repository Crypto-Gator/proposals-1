We propose the Boss DAO buys at least 1,000 apecoin ($ape) for the DAO treasury as a long term investment. 

At the time of writing $ape is around 13.24 USD. 

**Why should the DAO buy $ape?**
First of all, the ApeCoin community is a DAO just like the Boss DAO. They have different ways and governance but still they are a decentralized ecosystem what should be honored by the Boss DAO. $Ape token were dropped to BAYC and MAYC holders. On day one $ape was listed on all major CEXes. Which by itself is very impressive. At the time of writing $ape is listed on 63 CEXes. The hype and social sentiment of $ape is mindblowing. They had a trading volume in 24h of $3,002,209,390. ThatÂ´s 3 times the volume of ADA on the same day. $ape has a market cap of 3.6 billion dollars, a total supply of 1 billion coins. Sitting on place 37 of all crypto coins and just behind sandbox. With that sentiment and that utility we see a bright future ahead for $ape. 

**What are the risks?**
Just like in any other crypto asset there are risks involved in trading. The price action can not be determinanted now since the asset is too new. 

**What should the DAO do with $ape?**
The DAO should keep the coin in the treasury for the long term. The DAO should get involved in the Apecoin DAO and should use the voting power for the best interests of the DAO. 

**Last thoughts** 
We think no one missed the announcement from Blue Magic about the Apecoin today. We had a fellow BAYC member in the BCRC chat today. He told us that there will be a BAYC metaverse. Apecoin will be the asset for buying land and for the metaverse. The minting price for one land will be around 1 eth. If you think about it, that numbers are crazy. Just like our DAO it is Apecoin DAO where you can get a piece of BAYC if you can not afford one ape. 

**When should the vote take place?**
ASAP.
