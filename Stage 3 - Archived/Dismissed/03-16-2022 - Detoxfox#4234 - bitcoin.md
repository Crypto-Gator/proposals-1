I propose the Boss DAO buys one bitcoin for the DAO treasury as a long term investment. 

At the time of writing bitcoin is around 40k USD. 

**Why should the DAO buy bitcoin?**
As we all know, bitcoin is the og in the whole crypto market. Bitcoin is leading the market for the good and the bad. You don´t have to be a BTC maxi to see the value of bitcoin. The adoption of bitcoin has rissen dramatically in the last few years. It is bought heavily by retail traders, S&P 500 companies and even by countries. The entry price of BTC is quite good at this market conditions since it´s on a 42 % low of its all time high. The gains can be massive in the coming years. Just like ADA, BTC is a truely decentralised asset. I think most of us crypto enthusiasts would love to have a BTC in our wallet. 

**What are the risks?**
Just like in any other crypto asset there are risks involved in trading. When it comes to BTC there is also the risk of environmental concerns from governments and NGOs. The problem is that there is the narative going around that the proof of work mechanism could hurt the environment.  This could become a problem down the road. Still there is no ban of BTC in sight. 

**What should the DAO do with the bitcoin?**
The BTC should be put in the DAO treasury for the long term. After 3 years the DAO members should vote about the ongoing holding or selling of the BTC. In case the members vote for holding, the next vote should be after another 3 years. This should continue this way, so there is no need to vote about how long the BTC should be held.
In case the dao members vote to sell the BTC, the initial investment should go back to the treasury. The gains (if there are any) should be given to the members of the DAO.  It should be given out evenly in ratio of holdings of Boss DAO NFTs 1/10,000. There shall be no raffle, contest or something of any kind to get a part of the BTC sell but only holding a original Boss DAO NFT from the 03/16/2022 mint. 

**Last thoughts** 
I am no bitcoin maxi. I don´t hold any BTC because it´s just too expensive for me. In my opinion BTC will see massive gains in the coming years. Of course there are some factors we can´t know yet. And sure, BTC could also fail. But that is a risk a trader must take. Just like in all other assets anyone is trading for profit. I know BTC is controversial. And there is a lot to talk about. But from an investors perspective, how can you go wrong with BTC? 

**When should the vote take place?**
The vote should take place as soon as possible. The market conditions should be used to get a good entry point in BTC. As soon as possible means, as soon as the team has sorted out everything properly after the mint and after the VOX Drop. The team should be given enought time to get all financial terms in order.
