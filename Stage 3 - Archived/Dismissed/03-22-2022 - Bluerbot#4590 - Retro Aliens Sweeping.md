## Proposal Summary

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Retro Aliens floor in order to realize appreciation and utility from a cnft project with 6000+ members and growing.


## Proposal Details

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Retro Aliens floor as well as acquire 4 high rank nfts (top200).  At time of proposal, BossDao would acquire approximately 250+ nfts at an average price of 32 ada + four(4) top200 rank nfts at 500 ada each.

Retro Aliens is an emerging Pfp/music/Utility project of 4877 nfts traded for 230k ADA (opencnft.io) with an all-time high sale of 5000 ADA, with a vibrant cnft community, solid wallet distribution (1000+ holders), and second edition 2022 roadmap.  Previous 24 hour sales were 1000 ada.

Retro Aliens has community utility in the form of music rave events, collabs and giveaways, holder tiers, whitelist and mint incentives, and premium nft artwork by the project artist.  To highlight the music vibe, alien nfts have traits like headphones, beanies, whistling mouth, foil hat and clothes.

The Retro Aliens pfp cnft has a clean, whimsical design in the spirit of BCRC, with a tight character color palette, Hollywood ratpack-inspired trait sets, and limited edition theme backgrounds such as Burning Man and Mugshot.  The aliens themselves come in 31 skins, including 4 1/1 legendarys, the classic gray alien, and design innovations like space (2.5d), lizard (texture), and sketch.

An investment of 10,000 ADA in sweeping Retro Aliens would raise the floor to 45 ADA and reduce total marketplace listings by 17% to approximately 1180 (cnft.tools), representing 26% of total collection.  BossDao's significant holder status of 250 nfts plus high ranks would provide an Alien Whale role status immediately and a high-level of influence and stability for the emerging project, and directly leverage BCRC's experience in Starship Rocket design theme-based utility to the project's community.

Retro Aliens floor has recently started rising organically so approval of this proposal and start of buying should commence as soon as possible after mint, e.g. 03/24/2022
