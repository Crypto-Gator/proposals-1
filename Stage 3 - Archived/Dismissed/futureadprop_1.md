Project: Drops that require collaboration between parties assets for example BCRC Vox drop.

What will the Boss DAO do?
Will hold assets of the involved parties in a created wallet until drop. If the wallet is required to be submitted or verified in anyway that is responsibility of one of the requestors. The assets will be held by the DAO until the drop. After 24 hrs from drop the floor price will be evaluated. The fees will be charged as 5% of the dropped asset floor. For example if vox floor after 24 hrs is 1000 Ada the few to the dao is 50ada.

The process will be similar to the ancient ways of cardano escrow.

One of the participants will submit a request for holding
The request will include who's involved which assets will be held what the expected drop is and who will pay the fees: split, individual 1 individual 2. How the assets will be divided upon receipt of fees. All individuals must agree and send to the wallet. Collateral will be the assets required for drop until fees are received

Why should the Boss DAO do this? 
Allows community members to maximize holdings and generate some income for the DAO

What does the DAO stand to gain?
5% of floor value from all drops

How will the treasury be involved?
Treasury funds will not be required

How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Not applicable

When should the vote on this proposal be held?
Before the VOX drop, shortly after mint
